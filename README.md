## SphinxApp is the app I made as a part of my master thesis. It's the app for schools and universities which allows teachers to conduct simple quizes on students.

This is the server side of the app - API which connects the client app to the MongoDB. It's build with Express and Mongoose. 

Check the client app [here](https://github.com/altrazmedia/sphinx-app-client).
